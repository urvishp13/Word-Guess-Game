# Word Guess Game

This game involves 2 people: the Player and the Computer. The Player has to guess the name of the Music Artist the Computer has chosen. If the Player guesses the name correctly, he wins. The Player only gets a certain number of guesses to guess the name correctly. If he uses all the guesses provided to him, he loses, and a new game is started with the initial number of guesses restored.

The WOrd Guess Game is a Week 2 project of the Fall 2018 Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program. The project was redone in 2022 without recollection of how it was done before. It is a higher-difficulty version of the [Psyhcic Game](https://github.com/urvishp13/Psychic-Game).
